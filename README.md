"Practicando lógica de programación: challenge Encriptador de Texto"

Text Encryptor | Challenge ONE - Oracle Next Education
Project link at the end ⬇

This is the first Challenge of the ONE - Oracle Next Education program, where we were asked to create a text encryptor. This encryptor allows you to exchange secret messages with other people who know the encryption method used.

The encryption "keys" used are as follows:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"


Requirements:

It must work only with lowercase letters.
No accented letters or special characters should be used.
It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to its original version.
For example: "gato" => "gaitober" "gaitober" => "gato"

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
